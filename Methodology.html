        <h3>SDG India 2018 Methodology</h3>
        <hr>
        <p><b>Stages of building the SDG India Index</b></p>
        <p><small>The SDG India Index is a product of a chain of three stages.</small> </p>

        <p><b>Stage 1:SDGs and targets</b></p>
        <p><small> Each of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals are mapped with a set of 169 targets to be achieved by
                2030.These were used as the foundation for building the SDG India Index.</small> </p>

        <p><b>Stage 2:National Priority Indicators list</b></p>
        <p><small>The next stage was to identify the national level Priority Indicators and map them to the 169 targets
                of
                theSDGs for 2030.</small> </p>
        <p> <small> NITI Aayog selected a list of 62 Priority Indictors that was guided by the MoSPI’s National
                Indicator
                Framework.</small></p>
        <p><small>MoSPI was entrusted with the responsibility of identifying the nationally available datasets that
                align with
                the 17 SDGs and their 169 targets. MoSPI thus developed the draft National Indicator Framework for
                measuring
                India’s progress against SDGs and associated targets.</small> </p>
        <p><small>The National Indicator Framework is the largest monitoring framework in the country, comprising of 306
                indicators. It consists of nationally defined indicators corresponding to national priorities and needs.
                Guided by the MoSPI’s National Indicator Framework, NITI Aayog constructed a draft list of 62 Priority
                Indicators. These Priority Indicators were selected by following a set of criteria.</small> </p>
        <div>
            <small><i>Criteria Adopted in selecting National Indicators</i></small>
            <ol>
                <small>
                    <li>Relevance to the UN SDG targets</li>
                </small>
                <small>
                    <li>Drawn from National Indicator Framework</li>
                </small>
                <small>
                    <li>Availability of data at national level for States and UTs from official statistical systems</li>
                </small>
                <small>
                    <li>Consent from respective Ministries</li>
                </small>
                <small>
                    <li>Ownership of data by the data source Ministries</li>
                </small>
                <small>
                    <li> Sufficient data coverage, such that data for at least 50 percent of the States/UTs is available
                    </li>
                </small>
            </ol>
        </div>
        <small>
            <p>
                Once the draft list of the Priority Indicators was selected, the same was circulated to the relevant 38
                Central Ministries and Departments, followed by a round of consultation with them, before being
                circulated to all States/UTs for their suggestions and comments. Finally 62 Priority Indicators were
                selected for computation of the SDG India Index.

                <small>
                    <p>The need to measure progress against SDGs rekindled an interest in the quality and availability
                        of
                        data for measuring country’s performance, scheme design and management. Although some progress
                        has
                        been made in strengthening the statistical system, this progress is uneven and India continues
                        to
                        lack in uniform statistical systems. All 29 States and 7 Union Territories use varied data
                        monitoring systems. Domestic requirements for good governance and accountability as a tool for
                        evaluating government performance have increased demand for reliable data. A national framework
                        will
                        enable the development of reliable, high quality data on a range of subjects. Data is currently
                        not
                        available for some of the 306 National Indicators developed by MoSPI. However, to initiate the
                        monitoring process, NITI Aayog decided to prioritise some indicators on which State-wise data is
                        available and consider those indicators for designing the SDG India Index.</p>
